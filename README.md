# MCP PDF Assistant

A modular, microservice-based PDF Assistant leveraging **Machine Control Protocol (MCP)** microservices for robust PDF **extraction, chunking, embedding, vector storage**, **QnA**, and **summarization**.

Built with **modularity**, **observability**, and **extensibility** in mind. Offers both **CLI** and **Streamlit UI**. Powered by **OpenTelemetry** and **Arize Phoenix** for advanced monitoring and debugging.

## Architecture & Components

| Component         | Responsibility                                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `extractor`      | PDF text & metadata extraction                          |
| `chunker`        | Splits content into semantic chunks                     |
| `embedder`       | Embeds chunks into vectors using LLM embeddings         |
| `vector store`   | Stores and retrieves embeddings using similarity search |
| `rag+llm`        | Handles QnA and summarization via RAG and LLM fallback  |
| `app_streamlit.py` | Streamlit-based UI                                     |
| `cli.py`         | CLI interface                                           |

## Workflow

1. **Upload PDF** â†’ Upload document via UI or CLI.
2. **Extraction** â†’ Extract text & metadata using `extractor`.
3. **Chunking** â†’ Segment text into meaningful units via `chunker`.
4. **Embedding** â†’ Convert chunks to vector embeddings using `embedder`.
5. **Vector Storage** â†’ Save vectors into a similarity-based vector store.
6. **QnA / Summarization** â†’ Retrieve and answer using RAG + fallback LLM.
7. **Observability** â†’ Monitor the entire pipeline using OpenTelemetry + Phoenix.

## Usage

### Starting MCP Servers

```bash
./start_mcp_servers.sh```

### Streamlit UI

```bash
streamlit run app_streamlit.py

### Command-line Interface (CLI)

```bash
python cli.py

## Project Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ app_streamlit.py # Streamlit-based user interface
â”œâ”€â”€ cli.py # CLI-based interface
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/ # Pipeline orchestration logic
â”œâ”€â”€ server/ # All microservices (extractor, chunker, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ start_mcp_servers.sh # Launches all microservice servers
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt # Python dependencies

## Extensibility & Observability

- **Pluggable Microservices**: Easily add or swap extractors, embedders, chunkers, and vector stores to fit your specific use case.
- **Telemetry Everywhere**: Integrated with OpenTelemetry and Arize Phoenix for full pipeline observability, tracing, and performance debugging.
- **Unified Backend**: Both the Streamlit UI and CLI utilize the same modular backend, ensuring consistency across interfaces and deployment modes.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for additional LLM providers** (e.g., Claude, Gemini, Mistral, local models)
- **Smarter chunking strategies** based on document layout, hierarchy, and semantics
- **Configurable pipelines** tailored for research, enterprise, and regulatory use cases
- **Multi-document summarization** (both extractive & abstractive)
- **Real-time collaboration**: Annotation, comments, and shared document review in UI
- **Cloud-ready deployments** via Docker Compose and Kubernetes
- **Extended vector DB support**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, and more
- **Enterprise-grade security**: Role-based access, auth systems, and compliance features
